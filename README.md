# multiple_disease_prediction_webapp
Multiple disease prediction using machine learning involves utilizing various algorithms and techniques to analyze and interpret diverse medical data sets, such as patient records, genetic information, and diagnostic test results. The process typically begins with data preprocessing, where relevant features are selected and outliers are addressed. Subsequently, machine learning models, ranging from decision trees to neural networks, are trained on this preprocessed data to identify patterns and relationships indicative of different diseases. The trained model can then be used to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases for a given individual based on their specific health data. This approach not only aids in early detection and prevention but also contributes to more personalized and targeted healthcare interventions.
